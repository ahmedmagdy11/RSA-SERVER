# RSA-SERVER
RSA server implemented using Node.js

# Usage 
A server to be run separately from your original back-end to generate private and public keys used for small data encryptions. I mainly did this project to encrypt data i send at urls like Query paramters.
It's also not meant to be exposed publicy to your front-end so use it carefuly by never exposing
the port you are running the project on to the public. 

# Installation 

- `git clone https://github.com/ahmedmagdy11/RSA-SERVER.git`
- `npm i` 
- `npm start`
